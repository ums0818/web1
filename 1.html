        <h3>Preface</h3>
        <p>A great discovery solves a great problem but there is a grain of discovery in the
            solution of any problem. <u>Your problem may be modest;</u> but if it challenges your
            curiosity and brings into play your inventive faculties, and if you solve it by your
            own means, you may experience the tension and enjoy the triumph of discovery.<br>

        <p style="margin-top: 40px;">The art of teaching, Mark Van Doren said, is the art of assisting discovery. I have tried
            to write a book that assists students in discovering calculus—both for its practical power
            and its surprising beauty. In this edition, as in the first seven editions, I aim to convey
            to the student a sense of the utility of calculus and develop technical competence, but I
            also strive to give some appreciation for the intrinsic beauty of the subject. Newton
            undoubtedly experienced a sense of triumph when he made his great discoveries. I want
            students to share some of that excitement.
        </p>

        <p>The emphasis is on understanding concepts. I think that nearly everybody agrees that
            this should be the primary goal of calculus instruction. In fact, the impetus for the current
            calculus reform movement came from the Tulane Conference in 1986, which formulated
            as their first recommendation:<br>
            Focus on conceptual understanding.
        </p>

        <p>I have tried to implement this goal through the Rule of Three: “Topics should be presented
            geometrically, numerically, and algebraically.” Visualization, numerical and
            graphical experimentation, and other approaches have changed how we teach conceptual
            reasoning in fundamental ways. More recently, the Rule of Three has been expanded
            to become the Rule of Four by emphasizing the verbal, or descriptive, point of view as
            well.
        </p>

        <p>In writing the eighth edition my premise has been that it is possible to achieve conceptual
            understanding and still retain the best traditions of traditional calculus. The book
            contains elements of reform, but within the context of a traditional curriculum.
