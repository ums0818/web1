        <h3>Solving Linear Equations</h3>
     
        <p><strong>Linear Equation</strong> – An equation containing a variable that is raised to the first power. These
            equations will generally have one variable in the rule of the equation and another variable that
            names the equation.

        <p style="margin-top: 40px;"><strong>Revenue</strong> – The amount of money brought into a business through sales. Revenue is often calculated
            as revenue = price * quantity sold.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Cost</strong> – The amount of money spent by a business to create and/or sell a product. Cost usually
            includes both fixed costs and variable costs. Fixed costs are the same each month or year, and
            variable costs change depending on the number of items produced and/or sold. 
        </p>

        <p><strong>Profit</strong> – The amount of money left after all costs. Profit = Revenue – Cost.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Break-even point</strong> – A company breaks even when their revenue equals their cost or when their
            profit is zero.
